### Executive Summary
This backlog prioritizes the most technically complex and foundational pieces first, focusing on risk mitigation. The success of the entire project hinges on the core on-chain and cross-chain logic.

**The Hardest Part to Begin With**: The core cross-chain interaction between the ICP canister and the EVM chain, specifically:
1. **ICP Canister's Ethereum Communication**: Implementing HTTPS Outcalls to read EVM state and using Chain-Key Signatures (ckETH) to sign and send transactions to the EVM chain
2. **Core HTLC Logic on Both Chains**: Creating the fundamental lock, claim, and refund functions on both ICP canister (Rust) and EVM contract (Solidity)

---

## Phase 1: The On-Chain Foundation (Highest Priority)
**Goal**: Prove the core HTLC mechanics and cross-chain communication can work in isolation.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
1. **Cross-chain Communication**: Mitigated by starting with simple HTTPS outcalls and gradually adding complexity
2. **Transaction Signing**: Mitigated by thorough testing with testnets before mainnet deployment
3. **Token Integration**: Mitigated by using standard ICRC interfaces and comprehensive testing

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to P0 priorities before moving to P1/P2
2. **Integration Complexity**: Early proof-of-concept for cross-chain communication
3. **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests for all critical functions

### Success Metrics
- [ ] P0 stories completed within 2-3 weeks
- [ ] End-to-end swap working within 4-5 weeks
- [ ] Basic UI functional within 6-7 weeks
- [ ] All critical security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] >90% test coverage for all critical components
