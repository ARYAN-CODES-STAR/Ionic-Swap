# ICP Canister Test Automation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the automated testing suite for the Ionic-Swap ICP canister's HTLC functionality, 1inch Fusion+ API integration, and partial fills system. The test automation script (`test_automation.sh`) provides comprehensive coverage of all core features implemented in the `fusion_htlc_canister`, making it hackathon-ready.

## Test Automation Script: `test_automation.sh`

### Purpose and Design

The test automation script is designed to:
- **Automate repetitive testing**: Eliminate manual `dfx canister call` commands
- **Provide clear feedback**: Color-coded output with success/failure indicators
- **Test complete workflows**: From HTLC creation to 1inch API integration and partial fills
- **Validate error handling**: Ensure proper responses for invalid inputs
- **Extract dynamic values**: Automatically capture generated IDs for subsequent tests
- **Comprehensive 1inch API testing**: Validate all Fusion+ API endpoints
- **HTLC lifecycle validation**: Test complete HTLC workflows from creation to completion

### Script Structure

#### Configuration Section
```bash
CANISTER_NAME="fusion_htlc_canister"
TEST_RESOLVER_ADDRESS="0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6"
TEST_HTLC_ID=""
TEST_FILL_ID=""
```

**Why**: Centralizes test configuration for easy modification and reuse across test scenarios.

#### Helper Functions

1. **Logging Functions** (`log_info`, `log_success`, `log_warning`, `log_error`)
   - **Purpose**: Provide consistent, color-coded output for different message types
   - **Why**: Makes test results easy to read and identify issues quickly

2. **`execute_call(method, args, description)`**
   - **Purpose**: Execute dfx canister calls and capture results
   - **Why**: Standardizes test execution, provides consistent error handling, and documents what each test is doing

3. **`extract_value(output, pattern)`**
   - **Purpose**: Extract dynamic values (like HTLC IDs and Fill IDs) from dfx output
   - **Why**: Enables subsequent tests to use generated IDs without manual intervention
   - **Enhanced**: Now properly handles HTLC and Fill ID formats with timestamps

## Test Scenarios and Their Purpose
