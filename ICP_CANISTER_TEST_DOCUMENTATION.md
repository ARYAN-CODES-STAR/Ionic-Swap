# ICP Canister Test Automation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the automated testing suite for the Ionic-Swap ICP canister's partial fills, relayer, and resolver functionality. The test automation script (`test_automation.sh`) provides comprehensive coverage of all core features implemented in the `fusion_htlc_canister`.

## Test Automation Script: `test_automation.sh`

### Purpose and Design

The test automation script is designed to:
- **Automate repetitive testing**: Eliminate manual `dfx canister call` commands
- **Provide clear feedback**: Color-coded output with success/failure indicators
- **Test complete workflows**: From resolver registration to multiple partial fills
- **Validate error handling**: Ensure proper responses for invalid inputs
- **Extract dynamic values**: Automatically capture generated IDs for subsequent tests

### Script Structure

#### Configuration Section
```bash
CANISTER_NAME="fusion_htlc_canister"
TEST_RESOLVER_ADDRESS="0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6"
TEST_HTLC_ID=""
TEST_FILL_ID=""
```

**Why**: Centralizes test configuration for easy modification and reuse across test scenarios.

#### Helper Functions

1. **Logging Functions** (`log_info`, `log_success`, `log_warning`, `log_error`)
   - **Purpose**: Provide consistent, color-coded output for different message types
   - **Why**: Makes test results easy to read and identify issues quickly

2. **`execute_call(method, args, description)`**
   - **Purpose**: Execute dfx canister calls and capture results
   - **Why**: Standardizes test execution, provides consistent error handling, and documents what each test is doing

3. **`extract_value(output, pattern)`**
   - **Purpose**: Extract dynamic values (like HTLC IDs) from dfx output
   - **Why**: Enables subsequent tests to use generated IDs without manual intervention

## Test Scenarios and Their Purpose

### Test 1: Resolver Registration
```bash
execute_call "register_resolver" "(\"$TEST_RESOLVER_ADDRESS\", vec {variant {Ethereum}; variant {ICP}})" "Register resolver with Ethereum and ICP support"
```

**What it does**: Registers a new resolver with support for both Ethereum and ICP chains.

**Why this test**: 
- Validates the resolver registration mechanism
- Ensures proper chain type handling
- Tests the foundation for all resolver-related functionality

**Expected result**: `(variant { ok })`

### Test 2: Resolver Details Retrieval
```bash
execute_call "get_resolver" "(\"$TEST_RESOLVER_ADDRESS\")" "Get resolver details"
```

**What it does**: Retrieves and displays the complete resolver information.

**Why this test**:
- Verifies that resolver data is stored correctly
- Confirms all resolver fields are populated
- Tests the query functionality for resolvers

**Expected result**: Resolver record with address, supported chains, active status, and statistics

### Test 3: Active Resolvers List
```bash
execute_call "get_active_resolvers" "()" "Get all active resolvers"
```

**What it does**: Retrieves all currently active resolvers in the system.

**Why this test**:
- Tests the resolver listing functionality
- Validates that newly registered resolvers appear in the list
- Ensures proper filtering of active vs inactive resolvers

**Expected result**: Array containing the registered resolver

### Test 4: Chain-Specific Resolvers
```bash
execute_call "get_resolvers_for_chain" "(variant {Ethereum})" "Get resolvers supporting Ethereum"
```

**What it does**: Filters resolvers by supported chain type.

**Why this test**:
- Validates chain-specific resolver filtering
- Tests the chain type matching logic
- Ensures proper variant handling for chain types

**Expected result**: Array containing resolvers that support Ethereum

### Test 5: HTLC Creation
```bash
local future_time=$(($(date +%s) + 3600))000000000  # 1 hour from now in nanoseconds
result=$(dfx canister call $CANISTER_NAME create_htlc "(principal \"2vxsx-fae\", 1000, principal \"2vxsx-fae\", $future_time, variant {Ethereum}, opt \"$TEST_RESOLVER_ADDRESS\")" 2>&1)
```

**What it does**: Creates a new HTLC with a future expiration time.

**Why this test**:
- Tests the core HTLC creation functionality
- Validates expiration time handling (must be in the future)
- Ensures proper principal and amount handling
- Extracts the generated HTLC ID for subsequent tests

**Key features**:
- **Dynamic time calculation**: Uses current time + 1 hour to ensure valid expiration
- **ID extraction**: Captures the generated HTLC ID for use in later tests
- **Error handling**: Validates successful creation before proceeding

**Expected result**: `(variant { ok = "htlc_[ID]" })`

### Test 6: 1inch Order Linking
```bash
execute_call "link_1inch_order" "(\"$TEST_HTLC_ID\", record {...}, true, opt 0)" "Link 1inch order to HTLC"
```

**What it does**: Links a mock 1inch Fusion+ order to the created HTLC.

**Why this test**:
- Tests the integration between HTLC and 1inch orders
- Validates the order data structure
- Ensures proper initialization of partial fill tracking
- Tests the `is_source_chain` parameter

**Expected result**: `(variant { ok })`

### Test 7: Partial Fill Creation
```bash
result=$(dfx canister call $CANISTER_NAME create_partial_fill "(\"$TEST_HTLC_ID\", 500, \"secret_hash_123\", \"$TEST_RESOLVER_ADDRESS\")" 2>&1)
```

**What it does**: Creates a partial fill for the HTLC order.

**Why this test**:
- Tests the partial fill creation mechanism

- Ensures proper secret hash handling
- Extracts the generated fill ID for subsequent tests

**Key features**:
- **Amount validation**: Tests that partial fill amount is within limits
- **ID extraction**: Captures the generated fill ID
- **Resolver association**: Links the fill to a specific resolver

**Expected result**: `(variant { ok = "fill_[ID]" })`

### Test 8: Partial Fill Details
```bash
execute_call "get_partial_fill" "(\"$TEST_FILL_ID\")" "Get partial fill details"
```

**What it does**: Retrieves the complete details of the created partial fill.

**Why this test**:
- Validates that partial fill data is stored correctly
- Confirms all fill fields are populated
- Tests the query functionality for partial fills

**Expected result**: Partial fill record with status "Pending"

### Test 9: HTLC Partial Fills List
```bash
execute_call "get_htlc_partial_fills" "(\"$TEST_HTLC_ID\")" "Get all partial fills for HTLC"
```

**What it does**: Retrieves all partial fills associated with a specific HTLC.

**Why this test**:
- Tests the relationship between HTLCs and their partial fills
- Validates the partial fill aggregation functionality
- Ensures proper data structure for multiple fills

**Expected result**: Array containing the created partial fill

### Test 10: Partial Fill Completion
```bash
execute_call "complete_partial_fill" "(\"$TEST_FILL_ID\", \"secret_123\")" "Complete partial fill with secret"
```

**What it does**: Completes a partial fill by providing the secret.

**Why this test**:
- Tests the completion mechanism for partial fills
- Validates secret verification logic
- Ensures status updates work correctly
- Tests resolver statistics updates

**Expected result**: `(variant { ok })`

### Test 11: Partial Fill Verification
```bash
execute_call "get_partial_fill" "(\"$TEST_FILL_ID\")" "Verify partial fill status is completed"
```

**What it does**: Verifies that the partial fill status changed to "Completed".

**Why this test**:
- Confirms that completion actually updated the status
- Validates the state transition logic
- Ensures data persistence after completion

**Expected result**: Partial fill record with status "Completed"

### Test 12: Resolver Statistics Update
```bash
execute_call "get_resolver" "(\"$TEST_RESOLVER_ADDRESS\")" "Check updated resolver statistics"
```

**What it does**: Checks that resolver statistics were updated after completing a fill.

**Why this test**:

- Confirms 1inch API authentication works
- Tests JSON response handling
- Ensures external API integration is functional

**Expected result**: JSON responses from 1inch API

### Test 15: Error Handling
```bash
# Test invalid HTLC ID
result=$(dfx canister call $CANISTER_NAME get_htlc "(\"invalid_htlc_id\")" 2>&1)
if echo "$result" | grep -q "No HTLC found"; then
    log_success "✓ Invalid HTLC ID handling works correctly"
fi

# Test invalid resolver address
result=$(dfx canister call $CANISTER_NAME get_resolver "(\"0xinvalid\")" 2>&1)
if echo "$result" | grep -q "No resolver found"; then

# Complete second fill
execute_call "complete_partial_fill" "(\"$second_fill_id\", \"secret_456\")" "Complete second partial fill"

# Get all fills for HTLC
execute_call "get_htlc_partial_fills" "(\"$TEST_HTLC_ID\")" "Get all partial fills after multiple fills"
```

**What it does**: Tests the scenario where multiple partial fills are created for the same HTLC.

**Why this test**:
- Validates multiple fill handling
